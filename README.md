## Taurus Services Coding Challenge

This repository was created to share the code for the Taurus Services programming test. Here, you will find the document with the explanation of each exercise. Each of them was solved on independent Python files:

- **Problem 1:** palindrome.py
- **Problem 2:** fraudulent_transactions.py
- **Problem 3:** underground_system.py

I also added a `tests.py` file to automate tests and ensure everything keeps working when some portion of the code is modified. You can also have a look and execute the tests with the command `python tests.py`.
